# weather

 WeatherTask class is used to get the current weather in the background, using the device's current location. When the weather data is available, it is displayed in the UI by updating the cityText, tempText, and weatherText views.

This code is just a starting point and will need to be modified and expanded to include additional features and functionality. For example, you could add a refresh button to allow the user to update the weather data, or add support for selecting a different location. Additionally, you will need to use a weather API to get the current weather data for a given location. There are many APIs available for this purpose, and you will need to sign up for one and include the necessary API keys and libraries in your code.
